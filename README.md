# Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each of the volunteer's belly buttons. To complete this task, we needed to:

1. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
2. Create a Bubble Chart
3. Create a Gauge Chart
4. Customize the Dashboard

### Results

We were able to:
1. Populate the dashboard with a dropdown menu, where the user can select the test subject ID number.
2. Display the corresponding demographic information for that selected ID number.
3. Display the top 10 bacteria cultures found using a bar graph.
4. Display the bacteria cultures per sample using a bubble graph.
5. Display the washing frequency of the belly button using a gauge chart.

### Summary

Overall, I am very pleased with how this webpage turned out. We were able to populate the dashboard when the user visits the webpage and have the webpage update when the user changes the volunteer ID number.
